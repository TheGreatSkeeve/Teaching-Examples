# Getting Started
Download and install Python 3.9 - https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.1/python-3.9.1-amd64.exe

## Choose an IDE
This isn't 100% required, you can run Python right from the command prompt, or by running the Python executable.  You can also write code in Notepad++, and configure it to execute the file in Python when you press a key combo.  Yes, I did that for a while.  
However, IDEs are very useful.  They streamline a lot of functionality such as virtual environments, or downloading packages.  They'll show syntax errors and give suggestions, and help you clean up your code.  

Personally, I recomment PyCharm - https://download.jetbrains.com/python/pycharm-community-2020.3.2.exe

There's also a lot of love out there for VSCode - https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=win32-x64-user

Download and install, and then open it up.  

I'll update this in the future, it's shorthanded and lazy right now.  Really should add a command to pull the example page from git, but git still confuses me.

## Examples
[Basic Python Stuff](basic.py) - A super basic overview of Python variables, if statements, for loops, while loops, typecasting, and a brief intro into Functions.  There will be a program which utilizes all these aspects, as soon as I write one.

[Common Libraries](importing.py) - Rundown with examples for several common libraries.  Time.sleep, os, subprocess, random, winsound, datetime, requests, praw

## Notes
This is by no means a perfect or comprehensive set of scripts.  More than happy to hear any suggests, or take requests on things to explain.
